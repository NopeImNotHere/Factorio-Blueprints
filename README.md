# Factorio-Blueprints
All the Factorio Blueprints that I've wanted to make public,  
These are the the Blueprints that I've created over the current playtime of 630 Hours (Steam)  
See License File

## Why an MIT License ?

1. Everybody is free to use it in whatever sense they like to
2. I still have control over mentioning the Author and copyright Issues in how I see fit
